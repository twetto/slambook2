	abstract = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)consists in the concurrent construction of a model of the environment (the map), and the estimation of the state of the robot moving within it. The SLAM community has made astonishing progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications, and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey the current state of SLAM. We start by presenting what is now the de-facto standard formulation for SLAM. We then review related work, covering a broad set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees, active SLAM and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of SLAM. By looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific investigation. The paper also contains the authors' take on two questions that often animate discussions during robotics conferences: Do robots need SLAM? and Is SLAM solved?},

	abstract = {Visual SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) refers to the problem of using images, as the only source of external information, in order to establish the position of a robot, a vehicle, or a moving camera in an environment, and at the same time, construct a representation of the explored zone. SLAM is an essential task for the autonomy of a robot. Nowadays, the problem of SLAM is considered solved when range sensors such as lasers or sonar are used to built 2D maps of small static environments. However SLAM for dynamic, complex and large scale environments, using vision as the sole external sensor, is an active area of research. The computer vision techniques employed in visual SLAM, such as detection, description and matching of salient features, image recognition and retrieval, among others, are still susceptible of improvement. The objective of this article is to provide new researchers in the ﬁeld of visual SLAM a brief and comprehensible review of the state-of-the-art.},

Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is currently regarded as a viable solution for this problem. As the traditional metric approach to SLAM is experiencing computational difﬁculties when exploring large areas, increasing attention is being paid to topological SLAM, which is bound to provide sufﬁciently accurate location estimates, while being signiﬁcantly less computationally demanding. This paper intends to provide an introductory overview of the most prominent techniques that have been applied to topological SLAM in terms of feature detection, map matching, and map fusion.},

	abstract = {Kalman filters have received much attention with the increasing demands for robotic automation. This paper briefly surveys the recent developments for robot vision. Among many factors that affect the performance of a robotic system, Kalman filters have made great contributions to vision perception. Kalman filters solve uncertainties in robot localization, navigation, following, tracking, motion control, estimation and prediction, visual servoing and manipulation, and structure reconstruction from a sequence of images. In the 50th anniversary, we have noticed that more than 20 kinds of Kalman filters have been developed so far. These include extended Kalman filters and unscented Kalman filters. In the last 30 years, about 800 publications have reported the capability of these filters in solving robot vision problems. Such problems encompass a rather wide application area, such as object modeling, robot control, target tracking, surveillance, search, recognition, and assembly, as well as robotic manipulation, localization, mapping, navigation, and exploration. These reports are summarized in this review to enable easy referral to suitable methods for practical solutions. Representative contributions and future research trends are also addressed in an abstract level.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous localization and map-building (SLAM) continues to draw considerable attention in the robotics community due to the advantages it can offer in building autonomous robots. It examines the ability of an autonomous robot starting in an unknown environment to incrementally build an environment map and simultaneously localize itself within this map. Recent advances in computer vision have contributed a whole class of solutions for the challenge of SLAM. This paper surveys contemporary progress in SLAM algorithms, especially those using computer vision as main sensing means, i.e., visual SLAM. We categorize and introduce these visual SLAM techniques with four main frameworks: Kalman ﬁlter (KF)-based, particle ﬁlter (PF)-based, expectation-maximization (EM)-based and set membership-based schemes. Important topics of SLAM involving different frameworks are also presented. This article complements other surveys in this ﬁeld by being current as well as reviewing a large body of research in the area of vision-based SLAM, which has not been covered. It clearly identiﬁes the inherent relationship between the state estimation via the KF versus PF and EM techniques, all of which are derivations of Bayes rule. In addition to the probabilistic methods in other surveys, non-probabilistic approaches are also covered.},
